// This entire file only exists to work around bugs in Media Foundation.  The core problem 
// is that there are some objects in MF that don't correctly support QueryInterface.  In c++ 
// this isn't a problem, since if you tell c++ that something is a pointer to an interface, 
// it just believes you.  In fact, that's one of the places where c++ gets its performance:
// it doesn't check anything.

// In .Net, it checks.  And the way it checks is that every time it receives an interfaces
// from unmanaged code, it does a couple of QI calls on it.  First it does a QI for IUnknown.
// Second it does a QI for the specific interface it is supposed to be (ie IMFMediaSink or
// whatever).

// Since c++ *doesn't* check, oftentimes the first people to even try to call QI on some of 
// MF's objects are c# programmers.  And, not surprisingly, sometimes the first time code is 
// run, it doesn't work correctly.

// The only way you can work around it is to change the definition of the method from 
// IMFMediaSink (or whatever interface MF is trying to pass you) to IntPtr.  Of course, 
// that limits what you can do with it.  You can't call methods on an IntPtr.

// Something to keep in mind is that while the work-around involves changing the interface,
// the problem isn't in the interface, it is in the object that implements the inteface.
// This means that while the inteface may experience problems on one object, it may work
// correctly on another object.  If you are unclear on the differences between an interface
// and an object, it's time to hit the books.

// In W7, MS has fixed a few of these issues that were reported in Vista.  The problem 
// is that even if they are fixed in W7, if your program also needs to run on Vista, you 
// still have to use the work-arounds.
